        "abstract": "The JETSCAPE Collaboration reports a new determination of the jet transport parameter $\\hat{q}$ in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) using Bayesian Inference, incorporating all available inclusive hadron and jet yield suppression data measured in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC. This multi-observable analysis extends the previously published JETSCAPE Bayesian Inference determination of $\\hat{q}$, which was based solely on a selection of inclusive hadron suppression data. JETSCAPE is a modular framework incorporating detailed dynamical models of QGP formation and evolution, and jet propagation and interaction in the QGP. Virtuality-dependent partonic energy loss in the QGP is modeled as a thermalized weakly-coupled plasma, with parameters determined from Bayesian calibration using soft-sector observables. This Bayesian calibration of $\\hat{q}$ utilizes Active Learning, a machine--learning approach, for efficient exploitation of computing resources. The experimental data included in this analysis span a broad range in collision energy and centrality, and in transverse momentum. In order to explore the systematic dependence of the extracted parameter posterior distributions, several different calibrations are reported, based on combined jet and hadron data; on jet or hadron data separately; and on restricted kinematic or centrality ranges of the jet and hadron data. Tension is observed in comparison of these variations, providing new insights into the physics of jet transport in the QGP and its theoretical formulation."

        "abstract": "A new framework, called x-scape, for the combined study of both hard and soft transverse momentum sectors in high energy proton-proton ($p$-$p$) and proton-nucleus ($p$-$A$) collisions is set up. A dynamical initial state is set up using the 3d-Glauber model with transverse locations of hotspots within each incoming nucleon. A hard scattering that emanates from two colliding hotspots is carried out using the Pythia generator. Initial state radiation from the incoming hard partons is carried out in a new module called I-matter, which includes the longitudinal location of initial splits. The energy-momentum of both the initial hard partons and their associated beam remnants is removed from the hot spots, depleting the energy-momentum available for the formation of the bulk medium. Outgoing showers are simulated using the matter generator, and results are presented for both cases, allowing for and not allowing for energy loss. First comparisons between this hard-soft model and single inclusive hadron and jet data from $p$-$p$ and minimum bias $p$-$Pb$ collisions are presented. Single hadron spectra in $p$-$p$ are used to carry out a limited (in number of parameters) Bayesian calibration of the model. Fair comparisons with data are indicative of the utility of this new framework. Theoretical studies of the correlation between jet $p_T$ and event activity at mid and forward rapidity are carried out."

Therefore, photontriggered jets can be used to study the jet quenching in the QGP medium. In this work, photon-triggered jets are studied through different jet and jet substructure observables for different collision systems and energies using the JETSCAPE framework. Since the multistage evolution used in the JETSCAPE framework is adequate to describe a wide range of experimental observables simultaneously using the same parameter tune, we use the same parameters tuned for jet and leading hadron studies. The same isolation criteria used in the experimental analysis are used to identify prompt photons for better comparison. For the first time, high-accuracy JETSCAPE results are compared with multi-energy LHC and RHIC measurements to better understand the deviations observed in prior studies. This study highlights the importance of multistage evolution for the simultaneous description of experimental observables through different collision systems and energies using a single parameter tune.",

Hybrid Hadronization combines quark recombination, applicable when distances between partons in phase space are small, and string fragmentation appropriate for dilute parton systems. It can therefore smoothly describe the transition from very dilute parton systems like $e^++\ud835\udc52^\u2212$ to full $\ud835\udc34 + \ud835\udc34$ collisions. We test this picture by using JETSCAPE to generate jets in various systems. Comparison to experimental data in $e^++\ud835\udc52^\u2212$ and $\ud835\udc5d + \ud835\udc5d$ collisions allows for a precise tuning of vacuum baseline parameters in JETSCAPE and Hybrid Hadronization. Proceeding to systems with jets embedded in a medium, we study in-medium hadronization for jet showers. We quantify the effects of an ambient medium, focusing in particular on the dependence on the collective flow and size of the medium. Our results clarify the effects we expect from in-medium hadronization of jets on observables like fragmentation functions, hadron chemistry and jet shape.",

We present recent developments in extending the JETSCAPE framework to build an event generator, which includes correlations between soft and hard partons, to study jet observables in small systems. The multi-scale physics of the collision is separated into different stages. Hard scatterings are first sampled at binary collision positions provided by the Glauber geometry. They are then propagated backward inspace-time following an initial-state shower to obtain the initiating partons\u2019 energies and momenta before the collision. These energies and momenta are then subtracted from the incoming colliding nucleons for soft-particle production, modeled by the 3D-Glauber + hydrodynamics + hadronic transport framework. This new hybrid approach (X-SCAPE) includes non-trivial correlations between jet and soft particle productions in small systems. We calibrate this framework with the final state hadron\u2019s $p_T$-spectra from low to high $p_T$ in $p$-$p$, and and then compare with the spectra in $p$-$Pb$ collisions from the LHC. We also present results for additional observables such as the distributions of event activity as a function of the hardest jet $p_T$ in forward and mid-rapidity for both $p$-$p$ and $p$-$Pb$ collisions.",

During the high virtuality portion of the jet evolution in the QGP, emission of gluons from a heavy flavor is modified owing to heavy quark mass. Medium-induced radiation of heavy flavor is sensitive to microscopic processes (e.g. diffusion), whose virtuality dependence is phenomenologically explored in this study. In the lower virtuality part of shower evolution, i.e. when the mass is comparable to the virtuality of the parton, scattering and radiation processes of heavy quarks differ from light quarks. The effects of these mechanisms on shower development in heavy flavor tagged showers in the QGP is explored here. Furthermore, this multiscale study examines dynamical pair production of heavy flavor (via virtual gluon splittings) and their subsequent evolution in the QGP, which is not possible otherwise. A realistic event-by-event simulation is performed using the JETSCAPE framework. Energy-momentum exchange with the medium proceeds using a weak coupling recoil approach. Using leading hadron and open heavy flavor observables, differences in heavy versus light quark energy-loss mechanisms are explored, while the importance of heavy flavor pair production is highlighted along with future directions to study.",

The details of the multi-stage model and the various parameter choices are described in [A. Kumar et al., arXiv:2204.01163]. A novel feature of this model is the presence of two stages of jet modification: a high virtuality phase (modeled using MATTER), where coherence effects diminish medium-induced radiation, and a lower virtuality phase (modeled using LBT), where parton splits are fully resolved by the medium as they endure multiple scattering induced energy loss. Energy loss calculations are carried out on event-by-event viscous fluid dynamic backgrounds constrained by experimental data. The uniformed and consistent descriptions of multiple experimental observables demonstrate the essential role of coherence effects and the multi-stage modeling of the jet evolution. Using the best choice of parameters from [A.

A model-to-data comparison with Bayesian inference is performed, revisiting assumptions made in previous studies. The role of parameter priors is studied in light of their importance for the interpretation of results. We emphasize the use of closure tests to perform extensive validation of the analysis workflow before comparison with observations. Our study combines measurements from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), achieving a good simultaneous description of a wide range of hadronic observables from both colliders. The selected experimental data provide reasonable constraints on the shear and the bulk viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma at T\u2248 150\u2013250 MeV, but their constraining power degrades at higher temperatures, T\u2273250 MeV. Furthermore, these viscosity constraints are found to depend significantly on how viscous corrections are handled in the transition from hydrodynamics to the hadronic transport. Several other model parameters, including the free-streaming time, show similar model sensitivity, while the initial condition parameters associated with the TRENTo ansatz are quite robust against variations of the particlization prescription. We also report on the sensitivity of individual observables to the various model parameters. Finally, Bayesian model selection is used to quantitatively compare the agreement with measurements for different sets of model assumptions, including different particlization models and different choices for which parameters are allowed to vary between RHIC and LHC energies.",

        "abstract": "The dynamics of shower development for a jet traveling through the QGP involves a variety ofscales, one of them being the heavy quark mass. Even though the mass of the heavy quarksplays a subdominant role during the high virtuality portion of the jet evolution, it does affectlongitudinal drag and diffusion, stimulating additional radiation from heavy quarks. Theseemissions partially compensate the reduction in radiation from the dead cone effect. In the lowervirtuality part of the shower, when the mass is comparable to the transverse momenta of thepartons, scattering and radiation processes off heavy quarks differ from those off light quarks. Allthese factors result in a different nuclear modification factor for heavy versus light flavors and thusfor heavy-flavor tagged jets.In this study, the heavy quark shower evolution and the fluid dynamical medium are modeledon an event by event basis using the JETSCAPE Framework. We present a multi-stagecalculation that explores the differences between various heavy quark energy-loss mechanismswithin a realistically expanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Inside the QGP, the highly virtualand energetic portion of the shower is modeled using the MATTER generator, while the LBTgenerator models the showers induced by energetic and close-to-on-shell heavy quarks. Energy-momentum exchange with the medium, essential for the study of jet modification, proceeds usinga weak coupling recoil approach. The JETSCAPE framework allows for transitions, on the levelof individual partons, from one energy-loss prescription to the other depending on the partonsenergy and virtuality and the local density. This allows us to explore the effect and interplaybetween the different regimes of energy loss on the propagation and radiation from hard heavyquarks in a dense medium.",

The JETSCAPE framework is a multistage framework that uses several modules to simulate different stages of jet propagation through the QGP medium. These simulations require a set of parameters to ensure a smooth transition between stages. We fine tune these parameters to successfully describe a variety of observables, such as the nuclear modification factors of leading hadrons and jets, jet shape, and jet fragmentation function.\n\nPhotons can be produced in the hard scattering or as radiation from quarks inside jets. In this work, we study photon-jet transverse momentum imbalance and azimuthal correlation for both $p-p$ and $Pb-Pb$ collision systems. All the photons produced in each event, including the photons from hard scattering, radiation from the parton shower, and radiation from hadronization are considered with an isolation cut to directly compare with experimental data. The simulations are conducted using the same set of tuned parameters as used for the jet analysis. No new parameters are introduced or tuned. We demonstrate a significantly improved agreement with photons from $Pb-Pb$ collisions compared to prior efforts.

It takes systems of partons and their color flow information, for example from a Monte Carlo parton shower generator, as input. In addition, if for $A+A$ collisions a thermal background medium is provided, the package allows sampling thermal partons that contribute to hadronization. Hybrid Hadronization is available for use as a standalone code and is also part of JETSCAPE since the 2.0 release.\nIn these proceedings we review the physics concepts underlying Hybrid Hadronization and demonstrate how users can use the code with various parton shower Monte Carlos.

Two combinations of heavy-flavor energy-loss models are explored within a realistic QGP medium, using parameters which were tuned to describe light-flavor partonic energy-loss.",

        "abstract": "Multistage models based on relativistic viscous hydrodynamics have proven successful in describing hadron measurements from relativistic nuclear collisions. These measurements are sensitive to the shear and the bulk viscosities of QCD and provide a unique opportunity to constrain these transport coefficients. Bayesian analyses can be used to obtain systematic constraints on the viscosities of QCD, through methodical model-to-data comparisons. In this manuscript, we discuss recent developments in Bayesian analyses of heavy ion collision data. We highlight the essential role of closure tests in validating a Bayesian analysis before comparison with measurements. We discuss the role of the emulator that is used as proxy for the multistage theoretical model. We use an ongoing Bayesian analysis of soft hadron measurements by the JETSCAPE Collaboration as context for the discussion.",

        "abstract": "The JETSCAPE framework is a modular and versatile Monte Carlo software package for the simulation of high energy nuclear collisions. In this work we present a new tune of JETSCAPE, called PP19, and validate it by comparison to jet-based measurements in p+p collisions, including inclusive single jet cross sections, jet shape observables, fragmentation functions, charged hadron cross sections, and dijet mass cross sections. These observables in p+p collisions provide the baseline for their counterparts in nuclear collisions. Quantifying the level of agreement of JETSCAPE results with p+p data is thus necessary for meaningful applications of JETSCAPE to A+A collisions. The calculations use the JETSCAPE PP19 tune, defined in this paper, based on version 1.0 of the JETSCAPE framework. For the observables discussed in this work calculations using JETSCAPE PP19 agree with data over a wide range of collision energies at a level comparable to standard Monte Carlo codes. These results demonstrate the physics capabilities of the JETSCAPE framework and provide benchmarks for JETSCAPE users.",

        "abstract": "The jet quenching or transverse diffusion coefficient, $\\hat{q}=\\langle(\\Delta k_T)^2\\rangle / L$, provides the primary metric that characterize the modification of hard jets in a QGP. A quantitative extraction of $\\hat{q}$ from measurements requires sophisticated jet quenching theory, precise and extensive experimental data, as well as an advanced statistical framework that compares theory to data. Within the JETSCAPE collaboration we have developed a multi-stage approach of jet evolution, where the medium-modified parton showers at high virtuality scale are described using the DGLAP evolution and simulated with the MATTER event generator, while the in-medium elastic and inelastic scatterings of partons at low virtuality scale are described using a transport theory implemented with the LBT event generator. The transition from the DGLAP phase to the transport phase of jet modification, and its dependence on properties of the jet and the local medium, has previously only been approximately estimated. The goal of this work is to use the advanced statistical framework to determine this transition. To this end, a simplified version of the state-of-the-art JETSCAPE generator is embedded within a Bayesian analysis framework for a simultaneous calibration on jet quenching data at various centrality bins in 200~GeV Au-Au, 2.76~TeV Pb-Pb and 5.02~TeV Pb-Pb collisions, from which $\\hat{q}$ is systematically extracted as functions of both jet energy and medium temperature. The dependence of $\\hat{q}$ on the medium-induced virtuality scale is quantitatively explored for the first time. This virtuality, in combination with the local temperature and parton energy, serves as a crucial separation scale between the DGLAP region and the transport region for jet quenching. Its median value is determined to be 2.1 or 2.9~GeV for two different parameterizations of the jet quenching coefficient.",

Each event generator contains a different set of assumptions regarding the energy and virtuality of the partons within a jet versus the energy scale of the medium and, hence, applies to a different epoch in the space-time history of the jet evolution. Here modeling is developed where a jet may sequentially transition from one generator to the next, on a parton-by-parton level, providing a detailed simulation of the space-time evolution of medium modified jets over a much broader dynamic range than has been attempted previously in a single calculation. Comparisons are carried out for different observables sensitive to jet quenching, including the parton fragmentation function and the azimuthal distribution of jet energy around the jet axis. The effect of varying the boundary between different generators is studied and a theoretically motivated criterion for the location of this boundary is proposed. The importance of such an approach with coupled generators to the modeling of jet quenching is discussed.",
