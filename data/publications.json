        "abstract": "We present a comprehensive study of jet substructure modifications in high-energy heavy-ion collisions using both inclusive jets and \u03b3-tagged jets, based on a multi-stage jet evolution model within the Monte Carlo framework JETSCAPE. To investigate hard parton splittings inside jets, we focus on Soft Drop observables. Our results for the groomed splitting radius and groomed jet mass distributions of inclusive jets show a slight narrowing compared to proton-proton baselines. We demonstrate that this apparent narrowing is primarily a selection bias from energy loss, rather than a direct modification of the splitting structure, by analyzing \u03b3-tagged jets, where such bias is eliminated or significantly reduced. We also show that quark jets exhibit genuine modifications in their splitting structure, which is not seen in gluon jets. These effects are clearly visible in the substructure of \u03b3-tagged jets, which are dominated by quark jets, but are not apparent for inclusive jets. This demonstrates that \u03b3-tagged jets offer a powerful probe of medium-induced modifications to the hard splitting structure of jets.",

        "abstract": "We investigate medium-induced modifications to jet substructure observables that characterize hard splitting patterns in central Pb-Pb collisions at the top energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Using a multistage Monte Carlo simulation of in-medium jet shower evolution, we explore flavor-dependent medium effects through simulations of inclusive and $\\gamma$-tagged jets. The results show that quark jets undergo a non-monotonic modification compared to gluon jets in observables such as the Pb-Pb to $p$-$p$ ratio of the Soft Drop prong angle $r_g$, the relative prong transverse momentum $k_{T,g}$ and the groomed mass $m_g$ distributions. Due to this non-monotonic modification, $\\gamma$-tagged jets, enriched in quark jets, provide surprisingly clear signals of medium-induced structural modifications, distinct from effects dominated by selection bias. This work highlights the potential of hard substructures in $\\gamma$-tagged jets as powerful tools for probing the jet-medium interactions in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. All simulations for $\\gamma$-tagged jet analyses carried out in this paper used triggered events containing at least one hard photon, which highlights the utility of these observables for future Bayesian analysis."

        "abstract": "QCD jets are considered important probes for quark gluon plasma created in collisions of nuclei at high energies. Their parton showers are significantly altered if they develop inside of a deconfined medium. Hadronization of jets is also thought to be affected by the presence of quarks and gluons. We present a systematic study of the effects of a thermal bath of partons on the hadronization of parton showers. We use the JETSCAPE framework to create parton showers both in vacuum and in a brick of quark gluon plasma. The brick setup allows important parameters, like the size of the plasma as well as the collective flow of partons, to be varied systematically. We hadronize the parton showers using Hybrid Hadronization, which permits shower partons to form strings with thermal partons, or to recombine directly with thermal partons as well as with each other. We find a sizeable amount of interaction of shower partons with thermal partons during hadronization, indicating a natural continuation of the interaction of jet and medium during this stage. The observed effects grow with the size of the medium. Collective flow easily transfers from the thermal partons onto the emerging jet hadrons. We also see a significant change in hadron chemistry as expected in the presence of quark recombination processes."

Since the multistage evolution used in the JETSCAPE framework is adequate to describe a wide range of experimental observables simultaneously using the same parameter tune, we use the same parameters tuned for jet and leading hadron studies. The same isolation criteria used in the experimental analysis are used to identify prompt photons for better comparison. For the first time, high-accuracy JETSCAPE results are compared with multi-energy LHC and RHIC measurements to better understand the deviations observed in prior studies.

We present recent developments in extending the JETSCAPE framework to build an event generator, which includes correlations between soft and hard partons, to study jet observables in small systems. The multi-scale physics of the collision is separated into different stages. Hard scatterings are first sampled at binary collision positions provided by the Glauber geometry. They are then propagated backward inspace-time following an initial-state shower to obtain the initiating partons\u2019 energies and momenta before the collision. These energies and momenta are then subtracted from the incoming colliding nucleons for soft-particle production, modeled by the 3D-Glauber + hydrodynamics + hadronic transport framework. This new hybrid approach (X-SCAPE) includes non-trivial correlations between jet and soft particle productions in small systems. We calibrate this framework with the final state hadron\u2019s $p_T$-spectra from low to high $p_T$ in $p$-$p$, and and then compare with the spectra in $p$-$Pb$ collisions from the LHC.

        "abstract": "Shower development dynamics for a jet traveling through the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a multiscale process, where the heavy flavor mass is an important scale. During the high virtuality portion of the jet evolution in the QGP, emission of gluons from a heavy flavor is modified owing to heavy quark mass. Medium-induced radiation of heavy flavor is sensitive to microscopic processes (e.g. diffusion), whose virtuality dependence is phenomenologically explored in this study. In the lower virtuality part of shower evolution, i.e. when the mass is comparable to the virtuality of the parton, scattering and radiation processes of heavy quarks differ from light quarks. The effects of these mechanisms on shower development in heavy flavor tagged showers in the QGP is explored here. Furthermore, this multiscale study examines dynamical pair production of heavy flavor (via virtual gluon splittings) and their subsequent evolution in the QGP, which is not possible otherwise. A realistic event-by-event simulation is performed using the JETSCAPE framework. Energy-momentum exchange with the medium proceeds using a weak coupling recoil approach. Using leading hadron and open heavy flavor observables, differences in heavy versus light quark energy-loss mechanisms are explored, while the importance of heavy flavor pair production is highlighted along with future directions to study.",

The reduction in jet-medium interaction during the early high-virtuality stage, where the medium is resolved at a short distance scale, is emphasized as a key element in explaining multiple jet observables, particularly substructures, simultaneously. By employing the MATTER+LBT setup, which incorporates this explicit reduction of medium effects at high virtuality, we investigate jet substructure observables, such as Soft Drop groomed observables. When contrasted with existing data, our findings spotlight the significant influence of the reduction at the early high-virtuality stages. Furthermore, we study the substructure of gamma-tagged jets, providing predictive insights for future experimental analyses.

The details of the multistage model and the various parameter choices are described in [Phys. Rev. C 107, 034911 (2023)]. A novel feature of this model is the presence of two stages of jet modification: a high-virtuality phase [modeled using the modular all twist transverse-scattering elastic-drag and radiation model (matter)], where modified coherence effects diminish medium-induced radiation, and a lower virtuality phase [modeled using the linear Boltzmann transport model (lbt)], where parton splits are fully resolved by the medium as they endure multiple scattering induced energy loss. Energy-loss calculations are carried out on event-by-event viscous fluid dynamic backgrounds constrained by experimental data. The uniform and consistent descriptions of multiple experimental observables demonstrate the essential role of modified coherence effects and the multistage modeling of jet evolution.

A model-to-data comparison with Bayesian inference is performed, revisiting assumptions made in previous studies. The role of parameter priors is studied in light of their importance for the interpretation of results. We emphasize the use of closure tests to perform extensive validation of the analysis workflow before comparison with observations. Our study combines measurements from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), achieving a good simultaneous description of a wide range of hadronic observables from both colliders. The selected experimental data provide reasonable constraints on the shear and the bulk viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma at T\u2248 150\u2013250 MeV, but their constraining power degrades at higher temperatures, T\u2273250 MeV. Furthermore, these viscosity constraints are found to depend significantly on how viscous corrections are handled in the transition from hydrodynamics to the hadronic transport. Several other model parameters, including the free-streaming time, show similar model sensitivity, while the initial condition parameters associated with the TRENTo ansatz are quite robust against variations of the particlization prescription. We also report on the sensitivity of individual observables to the various model parameters. Finally, Bayesian model selection is used to quantitatively compare the agreement with measurements for different sets of model assumptions, including different particlization models and different choices for which parameters are allowed to vary between RHIC and LHC energies.",

        "abstract": "The dynamics of shower development for a jet traveling through the QGP involves a variety ofscales, one of them being the heavy quark mass. Even though the mass of the heavy quarksplays a subdominant role during the high virtuality portion of the jet evolution, it does affectlongitudinal drag and diffusion, stimulating additional radiation from heavy quarks. Theseemissions partially compensate the reduction in radiation from the dead cone effect. In the lowervirtuality part of the shower, when the mass is comparable to the transverse momenta of thepartons, scattering and radiation processes off heavy quarks differ from those off light quarks. Allthese factors result in a different nuclear modification factor for heavy versus light flavors and thusfor heavy-flavor tagged jets.In this study, the heavy quark shower evolution and the fluid dynamical medium are modeledon an event by event basis using the JETSCAPE Framework. We present a multi-stagecalculation that explores the differences between various heavy quark energy-loss mechanismswithin a realistically expanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Inside the QGP, the highly virtualand energetic portion of the shower is modeled using the MATTER generator, while the LBTgenerator models the showers induced by energetic and close-to-on-shell heavy quarks. Energy-momentum exchange with the medium, essential for the study of jet modification, proceeds usinga weak coupling recoil approach. The JETSCAPE framework allows for transitions, on the levelof individual partons, from one energy-loss prescription to the other depending on the partonsenergy and virtuality and the local density. This allows us to explore the effect and interplaybetween the different regimes of energy loss on the propagation and radiation from hard heavyquarks in a dense medium.",

        "abstract": "It is now well established that jet modification is a multistage effect; hence a single model alone cannot describe all facets of jet modification. The JETSCAPE framework is a multistage framework that uses several modules to simulate different stages of jet propagation through the QGP medium. These simulations require a set of parameters to ensure a smooth transition between stages. We fine tune these parameters to successfully describe a variety of observables, such as the nuclear modification factors of leading hadrons and jets, jet shape, and jet fragmentation function.\n\nPhotons can be produced in the hard scattering or as radiation from quarks inside jets. In this work, we study photon-jet transverse momentum imbalance and azimuthal correlation for both $p-p$ and $Pb-Pb$ collision systems. All the photons produced in each event, including the photons from hard scattering, radiation from the parton shower, and radiation from hadronization are considered with an isolation cut to directly compare with experimental data. The simulations are conducted using the same set of tuned parameters as used for the jet analysis. No new parameters are introduced or tuned. We demonstrate a significantly improved agreement with photons from $Pb-Pb$ collisions compared to prior efforts. This work provides an independent, parameter free verification of the multistage evolution framework.",

It smoothly combines quark recombination applicable when distances between partons in phase space are small, and string fragmentation appropriate for dilute parton systems, following the picture outlined by Han et al. [PRC 93, 045207 (2016)]. Hybrid Hadronization integrates with PYTHIA 8 and can be applied to a variety of systems from $e^++e^-$ to $A+A$ collisions. It takes systems of partons and their color flow information, for example from a Monte Carlo parton shower generator, as input. In addition, if for $A+A$ collisions a thermal background medium is provided, the package allows sampling thermal partons that contribute to hadronization. Hybrid Hadronization is available for use as a standalone code and is also part of JETSCAPE since the 2.0 release.\nIn these proceedings we review the physics concepts underlying Hybrid Hadronization and demonstrate how users can use the code with various parton shower Monte Carlos. We present calculations of hadron chemistry and fragmentation functions in small and large systems when Hybrid Hadronization is combined with parton shower Monte Carlos MATTER and LBT. In particular, we discuss observable effects of the recombination of shower partons with thermal partons.",

In this manuscript, we discuss recent developments in Bayesian analyses of heavy ion collision data. We highlight the essential role of closure tests in validating a Bayesian analysis before comparison with measurements. We discuss the role of the emulator that is used as proxy for the multistage theoretical model.

These observables in p+p collisions provide the baseline for their counterparts in nuclear collisions. Quantifying the level of agreement of JETSCAPE results with p+p data is thus necessary for meaningful applications of JETSCAPE to A+A collisions. The calculations use the JETSCAPE PP19 tune, defined in this paper, based on version 1.0 of the JETSCAPE framework. For the observables discussed in this work calculations using JETSCAPE PP19 agree with data over a wide range of collision energies at a level comparable to standard Monte Carlo codes.

        "abstract": "The jet quenching or transverse diffusion coefficient, $\\hat{q}=\\langle(\\Delta k_T)^2\\rangle / L$, provides the primary metric that characterize the modification of hard jets in a QGP. A quantitative extraction of $\\hat{q}$ from measurements requires sophisticated jet quenching theory, precise and extensive experimental data, as well as an advanced statistical framework that compares theory to data. Within the JETSCAPE collaboration we have developed a multi-stage approach of jet evolution, where the medium-modified parton showers at high virtuality scale are described using the DGLAP evolution and simulated with the MATTER event generator, while the in-medium elastic and inelastic scatterings of partons at low virtuality scale are described using a transport theory implemented with the LBT event generator. The transition from the DGLAP phase to the transport phase of jet modification, and its dependence on properties of the jet and the local medium, has previously only been approximately estimated. The goal of this work is to use the advanced statistical framework to determine this transition. To this end, a simplified version of the state-of-the-art JETSCAPE generator is embedded within a Bayesian analysis framework for a simultaneous calibration on jet quenching data at various centrality bins in 200~GeV Au-Au, 2.76~TeV Pb-Pb and 5.02~TeV Pb-Pb collisions, from which $\\hat{q}$ is systematically extracted as functions of both jet energy and medium temperature. The dependence of $\\hat{q}$ on the medium-induced virtuality scale is quantitatively explored for the first time. This virtuality, in combination with the local temperature and parton energy, serves as a crucial separation scale between the DGLAP region and the transport region for jet quenching. Its median value is determined to be 2.1 or 2.9~GeV for two different parameterizations of the jet quenching coefficient.",

Each event generator contains a different set of assumptions regarding the energy and virtuality of the partons within a jet versus the energy scale of the medium and, hence, applies to a different epoch in the space-time history of the jet evolution. Here modeling is developed where a jet may sequentially transition from one generator to the next, on a parton-by-parton level, providing a detailed simulation of the space-time evolution of medium modified jets over a much broader dynamic range than has been attempted previously in a single calculation. Comparisons are carried out for different observables sensitive to jet quenching, including the parton fragmentation function and the azimuthal distribution of jet energy around the jet axis. The effect of varying the boundary between different generators is studied and a theoretically motivated criterion for the location of this boundary is proposed. The importance of such an approach with coupled generators to the modeling of jet quenching is discussed.",
